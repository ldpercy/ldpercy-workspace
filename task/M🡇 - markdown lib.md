Markdown lib
============

Have been trying to find something that will be easy to use for my needs, or adaptable/forkable.


from html-experiment:
---------------------

Loads of 'proper' ones out there, want to see if i can do a simple one-file version.

Heaps of little ones listed here, should just grab one of those:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319657/javascript-to-convert-markdown-textile-to-html-and-ideally-back-to-markdown-t

Preferably stick one of them into html-common, maybe write a wrapper so that I can use a std interface no matter what I'm using.

Adding as a git submodule would probably be good if I can.

Node oriented, browser use via cdn:
* https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it
* https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown
* https://github.com/markedjs/marked

Small, possible candidates
* https://github.com/adamvleggett/drawdown - written as a single class-style function
* https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/micromarkdown.js - small, but the code style seems a bit older & twisty, lots of var/for/while/if/switch, other older style stuff
* https://github.com/Holixus/nano-markdown - also a bit older style
* https://github.com/p01/mmd.js
* https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js		- unmaintained
*


None of these are an exact fit for me right now, will dig a little more and see if I can fork one of the smaller ones.


These two look like the most straightforward, have forked and  start trying out:
* drawdown
* mmd


Drawdown
--------
Had started here as it looked the most straightforward, but it's a bit more complex than it first appeared.
